	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<!-- <p>Hi - I'm Ramon, a software engineer in Chicago.</p> -->
	<p>
		I wasn't like every other kid who dreams about being an astronaut.  I was always more interested in what bark was made out of on a tree.  Richard Gere's a real hero of mine.  Sting would be another person who's a hero; the music he's created over the years.  I don't really listen to it, but the fact that he's making it, I respect that.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>I care desperately about what I do.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Do I know what product I'm selling?  No.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Do I know what I'm doing today?  No.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>But I'm here, and I'm gonna give it my best shot.</b>
	</p>
