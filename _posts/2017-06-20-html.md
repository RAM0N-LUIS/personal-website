title: What is HTML?
---
HTML is a way of writing words (i.e. a special "code" or "language") that says two things: (1) words and (2) how those words should be displayed.  It is used to tell web browers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari) what to show for any given webpage. Think of writing a movie script: you need to communicate both the words ("I love lamp!") and how the words should be said (*loudly with a mix of confusion and eagernesss*).  HTML does the same thing for for the internet: it says what words (or "content") should show up on a webpage and uses extra information called "tags" to say how those words should be displayed.

Here is an example tag:

`<em>What up, dawg?<\em>`
<br><br>

The '<' and '>' symbols tell the web browser that the words in between those symbols is information about how to show something.  In this example, 'em' stands for 'emphasize' and means that the web browser should start emphasizing words.  The <\\em\> tag tells the web browser that it should stop emphasizing words.  Tags that start with a backslash are called "closing" tags and tell the browser to stop doing something.  The example above uses a standard  format: the "opening tag" tells the browser to start doing something and the "closing tag" tells the browser to stop doing something.
